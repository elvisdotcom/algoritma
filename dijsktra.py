# Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the
# single source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge
# path cost, producing a shortest path tree. The origin implementation's
# time complexity is O(E + V^2) = O(V^2).
#
# However, Dijkstra's Algorithm can be modified by heap, for a binary
# heap, the time complexity can be reduced to O((E+V)log(V)).
